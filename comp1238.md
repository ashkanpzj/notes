##  Week2 - Number Systems

- Decimal (Base 10): Standard human number system.
- Binary (Base 2): Used in computing.
- Hexadecimal (Base 16): Uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F.
- 
##  Week3 - Unicode

- Similar to ASCII - assigns numbers to characters, but allows for much larger numbers and therefore more characters.
- While in ASCII the numbers are called "ASCII codes", in unicode the name used is "Unicode codepoints"
- In contrast to ASCII there are multiple different ways of converting the codepoints into a binary representation:
  - UTF-32 simply uses 4 bytes to store the codepoint number of in binary, but this wastes a lot of space because most bytes end up being filled with zeroes.
  - UTF-8 is identical to ASCII for all the basic characters but uses multiple bytes for codepoints above 127. UTF-8 is by far the most popular encoding on the internet.
- Unicode codepoints are usually written as hex number with prefix U+ for example U+21AA is the codepoint for this character: â†ª
Note that the binary representation for this codepoint will be different depending on which encoding is used, but in most cases we use UTF-8.
