## Week 1 - Evolution of Writing
- **Sumerian Language**: Used syllabic writing.
- **Epic of Gilgamesh**: Early literature (~4,000 years ago).
- **Multilingual Inscriptions**: Example of trilingual inscriptions (Old Persian, Elamite, Babylonian) - Wikipedia

## Week 2 - Number Systems
- **Decimal (Base 10)**: Standard human number system.
- **Binary (Base 2)**: Used in computing.
- **Hexadecimal (Base 16)**: Uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F.

## Week 3 - Unicode
- Similar to ASCII - assigns numbers to characters, but allows for much larger numbers and therefore more characters.
- While in ASCII the numbers are called "ASCII codes", in Unicode the name used is "Unicode codepoints".
- In contrast to ASCII, there are multiple different ways of converting the codepoints into a binary representation:
  - **UTF-32** simply uses 4 bytes to store the codepoint number in binary, but this wastes a lot of space because most bytes end up being filled with zeroes.
  - **UTF-8** is identical to ASCII for all the basic characters but uses multiple bytes for codepoints above 127. UTF-8 is by far the most popular encoding on the internet.
- Unicode codepoints are usually written as a hex number with the prefix **U+**. For example, **U+21AA** is the codepoint for this character: â†ª.
  - Note that the binary representation for this codepoint will be different depending on which encoding is used, but in most cases, we use UTF-8.

## Week 4 - GitHub Pages
- **Purpose**: Host web pages directly from GitHub repositories.
- **Setup**: Modify repository settings to enable GitHub Pages.
- **Themes**: Customize appearance using themes in `_config.yml`.

## Week 5 - Basic CLI Commands
- **Navigation and File Management**:
  - `ls`: List files in a directory.
  - `cd`: Change directory.
  - `pwd`: Print working directory.
  - `cat`: Display file contents.
  - `less`: View file contents.
